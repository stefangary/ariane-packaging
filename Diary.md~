I am impressed with how easy it is to customize a virtual machine for
use in the cloud.  It is also easy to start and terminate machines
so I have good control over which resources I am using.

Once logged in (an easy click on the VM Instances list), the VM is
lightning fast, and already prepared and connected to key aspects
of the compute environment (e.g. git, gsutil, and access to the
ParallelWorks cloud buckets) so it is easy to hit the ground running
with a newly created instance.
