#!/bin/bash -norc
#==============================
# Set up run space, run ARIANE,
# and run postprocessing (pp).
#
# The outputs to this are:
# 1) t.cdf - the particle tracks
# 2) hist.nc - a histogram of the particle tracks (postprocessing step 1)
# 3) alive.nc - a histogram of particle survival (postprocessing step 2).
# NOTE: the code for postprocessing steps 1 and 2 is still
# under development.  The computational time required for hist.nc (step1)
# will be nearly the same compared to the version used here.  The
# time required for alive.nc (step2) will be much less than step1
# and an example is not ready yet.  It is not critical that the
# postprocessing be ready at the time of the full runs, but I
# think it would be great if we could incorporate that into the
# fully parallelized runs to fully maximize the parallelization.
#==============================

# Make a directory based on input larval params:


# Run ariane
/usr/bin/ariane

# Post run clean up
rm -f fort.*
rm -f ariane_memory.log 
rm -f mod_criter*

#=====================================
# Postprocessing step 1: convert
#=====================================
# Convert to tcdf, output file is t.cdf
# Default ARIANE output has much more
# precision than needed, so leverage
# packing to create smaller output files.
#
# NOTE: There is a small bug somewhere
# that causes the resulting bdep variable
# (bottom depth) to have some occasional
# fill values on lab01 but not on my laptop.
# Aside from that, the files and subsequent
# processing are identical.  We don't need
# bdep here, so do not pursue further.
/usr/bin/ariane2tcdf -I ariane_trajectories_qualitative.nc -J -P 

# Clean up - remove original output file.
rm -f ariane_trajectories_qualitative.nc

#=========================================
# Postprocessing step 2 - split
#=========================================
# Spilt trajectories by Case Study
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET FOR SIMPLICITY
# tcdfsplit

#=========================================
# Postprocessing step 3 - spatial histogram
#=========================================
#
# This step is the best visualization tool
# to check if the overall results are reasonable.
#
# Will need to change the domain of the histogram (-X and -Y flags)
# and the number of particles (-P flag) to better
# match the larger-scale, full simulation
# WISH LIST: auto determine number of particles and domain size.
# Default output is hist.nc
/usr/bin/tcdfhist -X -100.0 10.0 0.25 -Y 30.0 70.0 0.25 -I t.cdf -P 1 46126 0

#=========================================
# Postprocessing step 4 - survival
#=========================================
# Default output will be alive.nc
#tcdfalive
