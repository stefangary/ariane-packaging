#==========================
# This script will continually
# check the output of runs already
# launched by scanning the
# created logs to create
# near-real time status
# reports.
#
# Invoke with:
# ./fe_watch_runs.sh &
#
# Once running, use something like
# the line below to see near-real
# time summary updates:
# watch -d gsutil cat gs://viking20/*.run.report
#
# Compared to the _slow version,
# this reporting script will only
# spit out the number of time steps
# done so far and one line of text,
# which will nearly eliminate the
# number of times awk is called and
# dramatically reduce the amount
# of disk writing and copying.
