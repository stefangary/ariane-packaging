#=======================================
# Our goal is to try running multiple
# isntances of ARIANE at the same time
# so that each instance pulls the same
# data from the kernal cache, thus
# minimizing the amount of time data is
# both copied to a node as well as data
# is read from disk to RAM.
#=======================================

# The following loops over years, seasons,
# and the 5 larval swimming parameters
# break up what could be a giant single
# run into many small runs.

#---------------------------------------
# 1) Set the years and seasons
#---------------------------------------
#
# This is done at the node setup stage,
# IN A LOOP OUTSIDE THIS ROUTINE.
#
# Any year/seasonal difference in the
# simulations is entirely due to selecting
# which subset of the input files are
# copied to the node.
#
# Breaking up the big runs by years
# and seasons should help distribute/parallelize
# the I/O bottleneck.  The full span
# will be [1959,...,2008] and [DJF,MAM,JJA,SON].
#
# NOTE: BECAUSE OF DJF AS A SEASON, THIS
# SCRIPT WILL DRAW DATA FROM YEAR-1 FOR
# DECEMBER.  Also, for the other seasons,
# the *start* time is the beginning of
# that season, so YEAR+1 will be used so
# we have full-length, one-year trajectories.
#
# Just to be clear - our goal is to create
# ensembles of simulated year-long particle
# tracks.  EACH TRACK IS ALWAYS 1 YEAR LONG.
# To account for seasonal and interannual
# variabilty, we launch particles, from
# exactly the same launch locations each
# time, at four different seasons at
# each year.  There are 50 years of total
# data we can use to drive our simulation,
# but here we use just two years.
#
# Although the particle tracks are simulated
# and post-processed separately, it is
# straightforward linear superposition to
# add together the tracks and post-processed results
# across the many simulations because the
# primary results of the post-processing are
# histograms (raw counts), not probability
# distributions (which would require weighting
# by number of individuals to combine).
#
#------------------------------------------

#------------------------------------------
# 2) Loop over larval behavior.
#------------------------------------------
# There are 5 parameters that govern the larval
# behavior so we have 5 nested loops here.
# The outermost loops must be larval behavior
# since that is the one set of parameters that
# changes from simulation to simulation.
#
# They are: time for ramp-up [s], time at surface [s],
# upward swiming speed [m/s], downward swiming speed [m/s]
# (NO need to specify negative sign!!!), and
# target depth [k-index units].  These params are passed in
# this order to build_larval_behaviors.txt
# as well as to ARIANE.
#
# To double check units,
# t1 = [0days to 10days] -> passed in [s]
# t2 = [4days to 42days] -> passed in [s]
# s1 = [0.2mm/s to 1mm/s] -> passed in [m/s]
# s2 = [0.2mm/s to 1mm/s] -> passed in [m/s]
# d1 = [12m to 150m] -> passed in k-index
#                      use VIKING20 vertical grid spacing,
#                      gdepw_0 in mesh_mask.nc to check!

# The script called here engages both

# good practice, but I'm doing that here as a
