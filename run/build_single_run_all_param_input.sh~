#=======================================
# Our goal is to try running multiple
# isntances of ARIANE at the same time
# so that each instance pulls the same
# data from the kernal cache, thus
# minimizing the amount of time data is
# both copied to a node as well as data
# is read from disk to RAM.
#
# After some experimentation, it seems
# that running all perturbations to
# larval behavior at the same time
# might be the most efficient way to
# leverage loading data to memory
# with the cost of not parallelizing
# the compute time but rather parallelizing
# the I/O.
#
# This script will build the
# initial_positions.txt
# and
# larval_behaviours.txt
# files necessary for this single run.

# To double check units,
# t1 = [0days to 10days] -> passed in [s]
# t2 = [4days to 42days] -> passed in [s]
# s1 = [0.2mm/s to 1mm/s] -> passed in [m/s]
# s2 = [0.2mm/s to 1mm/s] -> passed in [m/s]
# d1 = [12m to 150m] -> passed in k-index
#                      use VIKING20 vertical grid spacing,
#                      gdepw_0 in mesh_mask.nc to check!
