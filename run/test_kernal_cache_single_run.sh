#=======================================
# Our goal is to try running multiple
# isntances of ARIANE at the same time
# so that each instance pulls the same
# data from the kernal cache, thus
# minimizing the amount of time data is
# both copied to a node as well as data
# is read from disk to RAM.
#
# This wrapper will test a single run
# with all params.
