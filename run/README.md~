# Step 1: setting the larval behaviors

+ **build_larval_behavior.sh** will create larval_behaviour.txt given initial_positions.txt and 5 command line specified larval behavior parameters.  All the larval behaviors are the same and it's a 1-to-1 mapping of larval behavior to initial positions.

+ **build_single_run_all_param_input.sh** will create larval_behavior.txt with ALL 32 perturbations of the behaviors given initial_positions.txt.  After this script is run, one needs to rename initial_positions.all.txt to initial_positions.txt in order to run ARIANE with this input file.  I required this manual renaming processing to avoid overwriting the original initial_positins.txt file in case I do a git commit and forget I'm using 32x46k particles instead of just the 46k particles.

# Step 2: running the simulation
