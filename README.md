# larval-parameter-sweep-src

Scripts necessary for running parallel instances of ARIANE
I chose to keep this separate from the project
larval-parameter-sweep-doc because the docs could get bigger
with fancy images.

# Step 1: Building the container

This is only done once in a blue moon when the code of
ARIANE, netcdf (and dependencies), or tcdf is changed
and changes need to be incorporated into the container.
The script **build_ariane_container.sh** automates this
process.

# Step 2: Preparing the node for a parallel run

Input files need to be copied to the node with **setup_node.sh**.
This setup includes ~82GB for the VIKING20 velocity fields
as well as ~5GB for the **mesh_mask.nc** grid information
and ~300 MB for bottom properties information.  These big files
are stored in gs://viking20.

There are also smaller files  that set the parameters of
the run - they are pulled from ./run by the ARIANE
container during a run:

+ namelist
+ initial_positions.txt
+ larval_behaviour.txt

NOTE: larval_behaviour.txt is created locally
at run time by **build_larval_behaviour.sh**
during step 3, below.

# Step 3: Run the simulation and postprocessing

Then ARIANE and postprocessing routines need to be run
using the scripts and small specification file in
the ./run directory.

+ run_ariane_and_postprocess.sh
+ split_file.txt

# Step 4: Copy the output to long-term storage

Not implemented yet.  gs://viking20?
