#==========================
# This front end script
# will start the copy
# process, run the simulation,
# and send real-time update
# information
# to another location
# for "watching".
#
# NOTE: this does not use
# the watch command which
# is designed to send output
# to the screen, not a log
# file as we desire here.
#
# The way this reporting
# system works is that each
# node reports a summary of
# its status with a separate
# file.  It is important
# that each node writes to
# its own file - that way
# individual nodes can be
# watched or all nodes
# can be watched.  If they
# all write to the same file,
# they can potentially
# overwrite at different times.
#
# At the separate location,
# concatenate all nodes' progress
# files together like:
# $ watch -d gsutil cat gs://viking20/*.copy.report
