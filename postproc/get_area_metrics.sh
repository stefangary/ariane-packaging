#====================================

# The area_growth is just the change in area
# from start to finish.
# The relative_area_growth is similar but
# wrt the initial area.
# The area under a linear growth curve
# from A_i to A_f is area_under_line
# which is a triangle with 72 length
# units on the bottom and A_f-A_i height.

# The more complicated and interesting dimension
# is the non-linearity of the curve.  Greater
# non-linearity means greater change in diffusive
# regime.  So, the area under the curvy part of
# the curve is simply area_under_curve, the definite
# integral of the asum time series.
# The relative_area_curvature will be at most 2
# (a step change in area on the first time step)
# which is twice that of the linear triangle.
# relative_area_curvatures of 1 will be similar
# to the linear growth and those less than 1 will
# be very slow initial growth followed by fast later
# growth.

# For deliverable, go to 185 days only
# Every 5 days, 185/5 = 37, that's the 
# cut off instead of 73 (1 year)
