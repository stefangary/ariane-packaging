# Compute the time series for this file
#tcdf_most_likely -S -I $1
# This was done get_area_metrics, same
# command to create the input file for
# this script as well.
#====================================

# For deliverable, go to 185 days only
# Every 5 days, 185/5 = 37, that's the 
# cut off instead of 73 (1 year)

# We want to get the probability that
# a larval particle gets close enough to
# the bottom within a bottom depth range.
# The bottom depth range is set by the
# mask (1 for livable and 0 for not livable).
# The total number of positions close
# to the bottom are obtained by summing
# along the 3rd dimension (time up to 185 days)
# and x and y in the khist variable.
# The total number of all positions are
# obtained similarly from the hist variable.
